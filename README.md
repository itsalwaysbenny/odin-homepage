Made a card section,
and a footer section to give myself an easy win

need to style the lower header area with the image paceholder,
think it needs to be contained in another div to get the sizing right

30/1/22
Created and started to style all sections
Styling needs to be better, fixing section sizing is an issue

Styled sections, I have added more containers to help with spacing when the page is small. Could be better, but I don't want to spend weeks on perfecting it and then learn more to make it better easier
